# The MEI5 Time-Frequency Equation

**Discovered and developed by Eric J Franz / MEI5 – 2025**

---

## Overview

The MEI5 Time-Frequency Equation is a new theoretical framework that defines how time distortion (Δt) can be predicted and controlled using frequency, resonance, and modulation. Built upon Planck’s and Einstein’s foundational physics, this formula introduces environmental and experimental variables to quantify directional time shifts in real-world conditions.

## The Equation

Δt = μ × (r × h) / (m × c²)

Where:

- **Δt** = Time distortion  
- **μ** = Modulation strength (experimentally controlled)  
- **r** = Environmental resonance (e.g., Schumann resonance at 7.83 Hz)  
- **h** = Planck's constant  
- **m** = Mass (typically electron mass)  
- **c** = Speed of light

This equation enables a system to react to changes in frequency and environment with measurable time behavior—useful for resonance-based synchronization, time-state mirroring, or theoretical time-frequency control.

## Discovery

In 2025, this equation was tested using two independent systems running identical logic with no wireless or physical connection. When exposed to identical frequency input, both systems triggered synchronous behavior based solely on their internal Δt calculations—validating the theory behind this equation.
